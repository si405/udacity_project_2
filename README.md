Udacity tournament project

An example of using Python to access a Postgres database. Tables are created to represent Players, Tournaments and Matches. The data is used to keep track of match results and use the Swiss Pairing methodology to find out which players should play against each other based on their match history.

The solution involves three files:

tournament.sql contains the SQL necessary to create the database tables
tournament.py is the Python code containing the various functions to add and remove tournament data
tournament_test.py is the Python code that contains the tests that are executed to verify the functionality of tournament.py

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Create a Postgres database called tournament.
2. Connect to the tournament database and execute the file tournament.sql to create the necessary tables
3. Execute the file tournament_test.py to run the tests by typing python tournament_test.py at the command line
